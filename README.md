This is a basic wrapper to demonstrate autocxx and CPP to Rust interop with zxing-cpp.

## Build Requirements
1. Rust Nightly
2. CMake
3. Build in Release. This is a quickly put together example and is not intended to production use. I did not work out debug symbol issues so release build required.

There may be other requirements dependant on other OS but I only have access to Windows currently.
