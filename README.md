This is a basic wrapper to demonstrate autocxx and CPP to Rust interop with zxing-cpp.

## Build Requirements
1. Rust Nightly
2. CMake

There may be other requirements dependant on other OS but I only have access to Windows currently.

## Running the demo
After installing cargo and Rust nightly, run the following command:

`cargo run --release --example demo`
